Using data analytic techniques to visualize gender inequality in Hollywood

#What is the Bechdel test?
The Bechdel test is named after cartoonist Alison Bechdel, To pass the test, a story needs to have:
-At least two women
-The women need to talk to each other
-They need to talk to each other about something other than a man

After doing some reading on the Bechdel test, I was struck with inspiration. I decided to conduct data analysis on movie datasets to check whether or not they passed the test!

My aim was to collect data from various different sources, and answer the following questions about the Bechdel test:
-Have the Bechdel scores of movies improved over the years?
-Do movies with higher IMDB ratings have higher Bechdel scores?
-Do movies with female directors have higher Bechdel scores?
-Does the budget of a movie have any impact on its Bechdel score?
-Do movies with higher Bechdel scores generate a larger revenue?

#Some interesting data findings include:
-Movies that fail the Bechdel test tend to have higher IMDB ratings.
-Over the years, there has been an increasing number of movies that pass the Bechdel test.
-Movies with female directors have higher Bechdel scores.
-There is no clear correlation between the budget or revenue of a movie and its Bechdel score.

Of course, this analysis was only done with the data I gathered from three places, and might not represent the entire population of movies out there.

Furthermore, there may have been other variables present that affected the outcome of this analysis, 
and it might be a good idea to experiment with data from a couple of other places before coming to a conclusion.

Finally, I would like to mention that the Bechdel test is not necessarily the best benchmark to measure female representation in movies.
It does not take into consideration how well written a female character is, neither does it measure meaningful depth of character.
